# Stlics

Stlics is a library for fuzzy constraint satisfaction problems (FCSP), implemented in TypeScript (The
original was written in Java). It offers classes of the components of FCSPs, variables, domains, and
constraints. In addition, as solvers, it offers many algorithms such as "forward checking", "flexible local
changes", and "SRS3". With these parts, you can program any problems and have solver solve them.

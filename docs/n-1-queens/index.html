				<p>
					In chess, there is a piece called the "queen," which can move freely in any direction—vertically,
					horizontally, or diagonally.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the N-1 Queens problem, you are given an <b>N×(N-1) board</b> and the goal is to place <b>N queens</b> on it. In
					this case, some queens will be able to attack each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
					However, the key point is that the <b>distance between the rows of attacking queens</b> should be as large as
					possible. The greater the distance, the better the configuration.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, if N is 4, you need to place 4 queens on a <b>4×3</b> board, aiming to maximize the distance
					between the rows of any queens that can attack each other. As N increases, finding the optimal
					configuration becomes more challenging, and solving this is the main objective of the problem.
